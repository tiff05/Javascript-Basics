# JavaScript Basics Lab


## The Set-Up

- Fork and clone this repository locally and in Visual Studio Code

- Create an HTML file called `index.html`

    - HTML document must have the correct global structure.

    - Add a `<main>` element and nest a `<p>` element inside of it

- Create JavaScript files for each exercise below. Link the JS files to the HTML document.

- Push up your changes to the remote repository



### The Tasks

#### Exercise One

Using a series of JS statements, write a program that takes the user's name. Ask a few  questions to get information from the user. After the user has answered all of the questions, print a summary of those answers to the console. Here is an example below of what an exchange may be. 


`web page`:Hi, What is your name?

`user input`: Codey 

`web page`: Hi, Codey! What do you do?

`user input`: Developer

`web page`: "Interesting! Do you love being a Developer?"

`user input`: Yes

`web page`: Codey is a Developer and loves it!


> We asked for the user's name and job. Then printed a sentence including the name of the user and their job. 

Your statements must do the following:

- Ask a user their name and accept user input

- Use `toUpperCase()` or `toLowerCase()` methods when receiving the user's input.

- Print their answers to the console in a sentence.

- Ask the user what they do.

- Ask the user if they enjoy their job.

- Last, create a sentence or sentences that wraps up the user's answers at the end that prints to the console. 

- Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.


#### Exercise Two

Create a series of JS statements that asks a user what their favorite color is out of 3 different colors (Give the user 3 colors to choose from.). Based on their color choice, write conditional statements that print a message to the console. You will need to declare an `array` for this exercise. Click [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) to declare an `array`.

Example below:

`web page`: Hello! What is your name??

`user input`: Liyah 

`web page`: Choose a color. Red, Green, or Yellow

`user input`: Green 

`web page`: You chose GREEN

`web page`: "Liyah chose the color GREEN."

Display the sentence(s) as a `<p>` inside the `<main>` element.

4. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.


#### Exercise Three

Write a series of JS statements that takes in a user's input of a number between 1 and 20 and fulfills the following conditions:

```js
    - If a number is < 5 - return "Tiny"
    - If a number is  < 10 - return "Small"
    - If a number is  < 15 - return "Medium"
    - If a number is < 20 - return "Large"
    - If a number is =  20 - return "Huge"
```

> You will need to use conditional statements.

- Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

#### Exercise Four

Write a series of JS statements that prompt a user for their name, rate of pay, and hours worked per week. The program needs to compute the total pay for the employee. If the hours worked are greater than 40, use 1.5 for the overtime rate. Print the result to the console in a sentence. 

> Ex: Leah worked a total of 35 hours receiving a pay of $350.


Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.
